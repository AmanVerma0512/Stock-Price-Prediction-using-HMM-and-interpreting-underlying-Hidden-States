# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-HMM-and-interpreting-underlying-Hidden-States
Implemented the concepts of Markov chains on stock prices as time-series data to understand its variation. Interpreted the underlying hidden states on which prices of stock indices depend. Modified a Hidden Markov Model to predict the future prices of a stock with a comparative time frame analysis.
