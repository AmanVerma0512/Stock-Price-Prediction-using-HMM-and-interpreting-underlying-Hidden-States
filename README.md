# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-HMM-and-interpreting-underlying-Hidden-States
The stock market is an important indicator that reflects the economic strengths and weaknesses of a country. An accurate stock price prediction is one significant key to be successful in stock trading. Stock markets are one of the most complex systems which makes it difficult to model in terms of dynamic equations. The main reason is that there are several uncertain parameters like economic conditions, policy changes, supply & demand b/w investors, etc. which drive the prices. These parameters are varying which makes stock markets volatile. 

Prediction of stock prices is a classical problem of non-stationary pattern recognition in Machine Learning and Mathematical Modelling. There has been a lot of research in predicting the behavior of stocks based on their historical performance using AI & ML techniques like- Neural Networks, Fuzzy logic, and LSTMs. 

One of the methods which is not as common as the above mentioned for analyzing the stock markets is Hidden Markov Models. We have focused on Hidden Markov Models in this project & compare its performance with the LSTM Neural Networks &  give a visualization for possible hidden states.

Implemented the concepts of Markov chains on stock prices as time-series data to understand its variation. Interpreted the underlying hidden states on which prices of stock indices depend. Modified a Hidden Markov Model to predict the future prices of a stock with a comparative time frame analysis.
